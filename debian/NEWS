xmltv (0.5.48-1) unstable; urgency=low

   Important notice for all users of the na_dd grabber:

   tv_grab_na_dd now uses Schedules Direct.  New accounts will be needed.
   See http://schedulesdirect.org or the man page for more info.

   The tv_grab_na_dd in this distribution replaces the old Zap2IT labs based
   grabber. After you upgrade, you'll need to run --configure again. NA_DD
   users should not upgrade until they are ready to switch over.

xmltv (0.5.46-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Due to copyright issues with the source website, the tv_grab_de_tvtoday
    grabber has been removed from this release. There is work going on to
    provide a replacement grabber for Germany, and I will include it in the
    package as soon as possible.

xmltv (0.5.45-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The following is taken from a post to the xmltv-announce mailing list by
    Robert Eden <rmeden@yahoo.com>
 
       On 6/19 Tribune Media announced that they will be discontinuing their
       Zap2IT Labs service on September 1, 2007.
 
       XMLTV/tv_grab_na_dd uses this for U.S./Canada guide data.
 
    This means that as of September, this grabber will no longer function.
    Developers are working to arrange an alternative solution.

xmltv (0.5.42-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Unfortunately, everyone who expressed interest in this package since I put
    it up for adoption on October 1 has been unable to follow through and
    actually take over the package.  Because of this, I've decided to give up
    trying to find an adopter.  I'm going to continue maintaining XMLTV myself,
    including the backport to Debian 'sarge'.  The workload has been relatively
    light lately, so I shouldn't have any problem keeping up with it.

  * This release provides fixes or enhancements for for tv_grab_za, tv_grab_fr,
    tv_grab_uk_rt, and tv_grab_uk_bleb.  Work is underway to make the grabbers
    much more "standard" so that PVRs are able to use them in a consistent
    manner, and this release also includes the beginning of those changes.

xmltv (0.5.41-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This package is still up for adoption due to lack of time on my part to
    properly maintain it.  I am looking for a Debian developer (or a non-DD
    with an existing sponsor) to take the package over.  I am sorry, but I do
    not currently have time to act as a sponsor for a non-DD.  

  * Six new grabbers have been added in this release: tv_grab_au, tv_grab_br,
    tv_grab_ch, tv_grab_ee, tv_grab_is, and tv_grab_re.  All of these grabbers
    should be considered experimental according to the upstream README.

  * The tv_grab_es_digital grabber has been removed from this release because
    it no longer works.  The tv_grab_pt grabber has been removed because it
    requires Unicode::UTF8Simple, which is not in Debian.  I do not currently
    have time to package any new XMLTV-related dependencies.

 -- Kenneth J. Pronovici <pronovic@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Nov 2005 12:45:31 -0600

xmltv (0.5.40-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * I have put this package up for adoption (see bug #331108).  My time is 
    becoming limited, and since none of my friends use XMLTV any more -- and I
    never have really used it -- I don't have much motivation to work on it.
    If you have interest in taking it over, please coordinate with me to make
    it happen.  I will stay on as co-maintainer if need be, but I would prefer
    to avoid responsibility for sponsored uploads, which actually take more
    time than just maintaining the package in the first place.

  * I apologize that it's taken so long to get a new CVS version of
    tv_grab_de_tvtoday installed in this package.  A year ago, it was almost
    never worth making Debian-specific fixes myself, because upstream released
    so frequently.  That doesn't seem to be the right approach any more.

xmltv (0.5.40-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Unfortunately, 0.5.39-3 did not make it into Sarge.  Sorry about that.

  * There is a new utility in this release.  The tv_grab_potaoe utility
    converts XMLTV listings to potatoe format.

  * There are three new grabbers in this release (or rather, two new grabbers
    and one rewritten grabber).  The tv_grab_be grabber grabs listing for
    Belgium.  The tv_grab_it grabber grabs listings for Italy.  The tv_grab_za
    grabber grabs listings for South Africa.  These grabbers should be
    considered experimental.

 -- Kenneth J. Pronovici <pronovic@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Jun 2005 10:38:24 -0500

xmltv (0.5.39-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since a new upstream release doesn't seem to be coming any time soon, I've
    taken the liberty of incorporating a few upstream fixes into a Debian-only
    release to close a few bugs.  I'm not sure whether this release will make
    it into Sarge or not, sorry.

 -- Kenneth J. Pronovici <pronovic@debian.org>  Sun,  1 May 2005 19:30:23 -0500

xmltv (0.5.39-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The tv_grab_it_lt grabber has been removed in this release, because it
    is not currently working.  This leaves no working grabber for Italy.

 -- Kenneth J. Pronovici <pronovic@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Mar 2005 22:06:44 -0600

xmltv (0.5.38-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release adds the tv_grab_pt grabber for Portugal.
  * The tv_grab_it grabber has been removed in this release, since the 
    upstream data source is not currently working.

 -- Kenneth J. Pronovici <pronovic@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Jan 2005 21:09:54 -0600

xmltv (0.5.37-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * There are two new grabbers: tv_grab_se_swedb, grabs listings for Sweden
    and tv_grab_it_lt is an alternative grabber for Italy.

 -- Kenneth J. Pronovici <pronovic@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Nov 2004 09:34:55 -0600

xmltv (0.5.36-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * "Experimental" HTTP caching is now available for some grabbers.  See the
    upstream README for more details on how to enable it.

 -- Kenneth J. Pronovici <pronovic@debian.org>  Mon, 25 Oct 2004 12:30:30 -0500

xmltv (0.5.35-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * I apologize that this release is so late.  Upstream noticed almost
    immediately that 0.5.35 was partly broken (tv_grab_uk_rt, see below) and
    said they were going to release 0.5.36 "soon".  That didn't happen.

  * The tv_grab_uk_rt grabber works again, because the website it grabs from
    kindly started providing machine-readable data to replace the web feed.
    However, radio listings are no longer available.  Note that I have
    integrated in changes from upstream CVS, since the official version in
    0.5.35 was broken.

  * The tv_grab_pt grabber has been removed because the site it grabbed from is
    defunct.
  
  * There is a new grabber, tv_grab_uk_bleb, which grabs UK listings from
    bleb.org.

 -- Kenneth J. Pronovici <pronovic@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Oct 2004 10:53:06 -0500

xmltv (0.5.34-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The tv_grab_nz grabber is now gone.  As discussed in the NEWS for 
    the 0.5.32-1 release, this grabber is now maintained by the PyTVGrab
    SourceForge project.
  
  * The tv_grab_hu grabber has been replaced with the tv_grab_huro grabber,
    which grabs listings for Hungary and Romania.

 -- Kenneth J. Pronovici <pronovic@debian.org>  Sun, 23 May 2004 15:23:56 -0500

xmltv (0.5.33-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The tv_grab_na grabber has been officially retired from this package.
    People who previously used tv_grab_na should use tv_grab_na_dd instead.
    New tv_grab_na_dd users are strongly encouraged to read the man page.
    Don't forget about the --old-chan-id switch if you depend on tv_grab_na
    channel IDs.

  * The tv_grab_na_icons grabber is now included in this package.  Use it
    (occassionally) to grab icons off the Zap2It site.

 -- Kenneth J. Pronovici <pronovic@debian.org>  Sat,  8 May 2004 12:04:24 -0500

xmltv (0.5.32-2) unstable; urgency=low

   * The tv_grab_no grabber is now included in this package. 

 -- Kenneth J. Pronovici <pronovic@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Apr 2004 20:45:16 -0500

xmltv (0.5.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The tv_grab_na North America grabber will be retired after this release.

  * The Python-based tv_grab_nz grabber will be removed in a future release
    because it is now part of the PyTVGrab SourceForge project.  XMLTV will not
    support Python-based grabbers in the future.  As of this writing, I do not
    intend to package PyTVGrab for Debian.

  * The tv_grab_na_dd grabber is now "official", and effort will be made from
    this point forward to maintain compatibility.  See notes in the upstream
    README for more information. 

  * This upstream release includes two new grabbers, tv_grab_pt for Portuagal
    and tv_grab_no for Norway.  The tv_grab_no grabber has not yet been
    included in the Debian package because it depends on HTML::LinkExtractor,
    which I am in the process of packaging for Debian.  I will release a new
    version of the XMLTV packages whenever libhtml-linkextractor-perl makes it
    into the archive.

 -- Kenneth J. Pronovici <pronovic@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Apr 2004 10:59:56 -0500

xmltv (0.5.31-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * I forgot to mention along with 0.5.31-2 that the tv_grab_na_dd grabber
    should be considered experimental.  However, I have generally heard good
    things about it, and I expect it to stabilize quickly.

  * With this release, tv_grab_na_dd grabber has been fixed so that it now
    works with newer versions of XML::Twig.  I did this by grabbing version
    1.24 out of upstream's CVS, as suggested by Aubin Paul.  I couldn't pull in
    anything much newer than 1.24, because newer versions of the script depend
    on the upcoming 0.5.32 release of XMLTV.pm.  Since this isn't a released
    version of the script, it might not be completely stable.  However, it
    should at least work better than the previous version did.
  
  * Per Marco d'Itri's request (bug #239889), the libtext-kakasi-perl package is
    now recommended rather than required.   This means that users of the
    tv_grab_jp grabber will need to install the libtext-kakasi-perl package by
    hand if they choose not to install all recommended packages.   I would
    really rather not do this.  However, the dependency on libtext-kakasi-perl
    results in download of the kakasi-dic package, which is really large.  I am
    forced to agree with Marco that I should not be requiring all users to
    download this large package when only very few users will need it.  Please
    email me if you have a convincing argument to the contrary.

 -- Kenneth J. Pronovici <pronovic@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Apr 2004 19:02:15 -0500

xmltv (0.5.31-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The 0.5.31 release adds a new grabber, tv_grab_na_dd.  Users of
    the existing tv_grab_na grabber should migrate to the new grabber as soon
    as possible, as the existing one will be removed in a future release.  The
    new grabber is much faster than the old one and also places much less load
    on Zap2It's servers.  (Besides that, Zap2it has been very generous in
    providing this service rather than just blocking tv_grab_na.)

  * If your grabber is "missing" and you don't understand why, please see
    README.Debian for more information.
