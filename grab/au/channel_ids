# the channel map file.
# Users may need to alter the last value for
# some channels if its incorrect (see man page).
# TZ (time zones) should be fine, but if your from
# remote Australia somewhere and pick-up channels
# from another state/region/timezone, you may
# want to change this to suit, simply enter your
# TZ in numeric form (eg: +1000).

# Date::Manip dosnt handle aussie timezones
# very well at all, hence forced to do some 
# conversions internally with tv_grab_au.
# leave your region with a EST/CST/WST to 
# let tv_grab_au attemp to convert for 
# Daylight savings times, otherwise type
# a numeric figure and it will not change
# all year round (eg: +1030)
